# configure vlans and access ports on juniper switch

# requirements:
# - python "ncclient" installed (in addition to usual jmespath etc) with `pip install netconf`
# - netconf enabled on switch, ansible users are added (with `prepare_juniper.yaml`)
# - switch
#     - is included in inventory group "network-devices.<site>" and "all-<site> groups
#     - has "switch_modules" and "protected_ifaces" set in host_vars

# tips:
# - if interrupted and "users are currently editing" received: get PID from msg
#   and kill session with "request system logout pid <pid>"
# - if "unable to open shell" or connection takes more than several minutes
#     - check for stale "ansible-connection" process left from previous attempts
#     - remove old sockets from ~/.ansible/pc 
#     - try to connect with ssh as ansible user
#     - try setting remote port explicitly (exort ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT=830 or 22)
# - current iface report is at http://websever.site.com/switch-conf/site1/switch-name.html

# restrictions and todo
# - changing vlan name (while keeping tag) will fail because of collision with previous vlan
#   name with same tag: vlans are only added and operation will fail if some vlan on switch
#   already has tag NN (please fix manually)
# - ranges are not currently checked for length; checks could be further improved
# - configuration details (like number of modules and names of trunk and aggregate ports)
#   could be obtained from device

# used vars:
# - group_vars/all-<site>: local_site, local_net, dns_domain
# - group_vars/network-devices: default_vlans, default_trunk_types, conf_report_*
# - group_vars/network-devices.<shop>: other_switch_names, shop_vlans, shop_trunk_types
